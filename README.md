### Purpose Of Webpage/App

This is a project created to demonstrate my ability to use jQuery in additional to use of random number generators to create a game with non-repeating images and values for each button.

### How To Use App/Guide

To get started, please click the link: [Click Me](https://xryswelter.github.io/unit-4-game/)
The game starts once you click on a gem.
- Each gem has a random value assigned to it.  
- Your goal value is randomized with each game.
- The goal of the game is to add up the gem values together until you reach the goal value.  
- Win Conditions
  - If you get the exact value as the goal you win.
  - If you go over you lose.
